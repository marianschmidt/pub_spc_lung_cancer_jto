In this Review we discuss the known biological effects of smoking on cancer cell biology and emphasise the clinical effects of continued smoking in patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Although evidence supports the need for inclusion of dedicated tobacco cessation efforts for patients with cancer, clinicians should consider the methods used to provide evidence-based tobacco cessation support and the available resources to deliver and maintain consistent tobacco cessation support. We also address the variables to consider in the design and implementation of a sustainable tobacco cessation programme.},

  abstract = {Background Lung cancer 5-year survival has doubled over 15 years. Although the risk of second primary cancer is recognised, quantification over time is lacking. We describe the incidence of second and higher order smoking-related primary cancers in lung cancer survivors, identifying high-incidence groups and how incidence changes over time from first diagnosis. Methods Data on smoking-related primary cancers (lung, laryngeal, head and neck, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and bladder) diagnosed in England between 2000 and 2014 were obtained from Public Health England National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. We calculated absolute incidence rates and standardised incidence rate ratios, both overall and for various subgroups of second primary cancer for up to 10 years from the initial diagnosis of lung cancer, using Poisson regression. Results Elevated incidence of smoking-related second primary cancer persists for at least 10 years from first lung cancer diagnosis with those aged 50 and 79 at first diagnosis at particularly high risk. The most frequent type of second malignancy was lung cancer although the highest standardised incidence rate ratios were for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (2.4) and laryngeal cancers (2.8) and consistently higher in women than in men. Over the last decade, the incidence of second primary lung cancer has doubled. Conclusion Lung cancer survivors have increased the incidence of subsequent lung, laryngeal, head and neck and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma for at least a decade from the first diagnosis. Consideration should be given to increasing routine follow-up from 5 years to 10 years for those at highest risk, alongside surveillance for other smoking-related cancers.},

  abstract = {While there are a growing number of cancer survivors, this population is at increased risk of developing second primary malignancies (SPMs). We described the incidence, most common tumor sites, and trends in burden of SPM among survivors of the most commonly diagnosed smoking-related cancers. The current study was a population-based study of patients diagnosed with a primary malignancy from the top 10 smoking-related cancer sites between 2000 and 2014 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. SPM risks were quantified using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) per 10,000 person-years at risk (PYR). Trends in the burden of SPM were assessed using Joinpoint regression models. A cohort of 1,608,607 patients was identified, 119,980 (7.5\%) of whom developed SPM (76\% of the SPMs were smoking-related). The overall SIR of developing second primary malignancies was 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.50\textendash 1.52) and the EAR was 73.3 cases per 10,000 PYR compared to the general population. Survivors of head and neck cancer had the highest risk of developing a SPM (SIR = 2.06) and urinary bladder cancer had the highest excess burden (EAR = 151.4 per 10,000 PYR). The excess burden of SPM for all smoking-related cancers decreased between 2000 and 2003 (annual percentage change [APC] = -13.7\%; p = 0.007) but increased slightly between 2003 and 2014 (APC = 1.6\%, p = 0.032). We show that 1-in-12 survivors of smoking-related cancers developed an SPM. With the significant increase in the burden of SPM from smoking-related cancers in the last decade, clinicians should be cognizant of long-term smoking-related cancer risks among these patients as part of their survivorship care plans.},

  abstract = {Cancer survivors face an increased likelihood of being subsequently diagnosed with another cancer. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative risk of survivors developing a second primary cancer in Queensland, Australia. Standardised incidence rates stratified by type of first primary cancer, type of second primary cancer, sex, age at first diagnosis, period of first diagnosis and follow-up interval were calculated for residents of Queensland, Australia, who were diagnosed with a first primary invasive cancer between 1982 and 2001 and survived for a minimum of 2 months. A total of 23,580 second invasive primary cancers were observed over 1,370,247 years of follow-up among 204,962 cancer patients. Both males (SIR = 1.22; 95\% CI = 1.20-1.24) and females (SIR = 1.36; 95\% CI = 1.33-1.39) within the study cohort were found to have a significant excess risk of developing a second cancer relative to the incidence of cancer in the general population. The observed number of second primary cancers was also higher than expected within each age group, across all time periods and during each follow-up interval. The excess risk of developing a second malignancy among cancer survivors can likely be attributed to factors including similar aetiologies, genetics and the effects of treatment, underlining the need for ongoing monitoring of cancer patients to detect subsequent tumours at an early stage. Education campaigns developed specifically for survivors may be required to lessen the prevalence of known cancer risk factors.},

  abstract = {We conducted a systematic meta-analysis of observational studies on cigarette smoking and cancer from 1961 to 2003. The aim was to quantify the risk for 13 cancer sites, recognized to be related to tobacco smoking by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and to analyze the risk variation for each site in a systematic manner. We extracted data from 254 reports published between 1961 and 2003 (177 case-control studies, 75 cohorts and 2 nested case-control studies) included in the 2004 IARC Monograph on Tobacco Smoke and Involuntary Smoking. The analyses were carried out on 216 studies with reported estimates for `current' and/or `former' smokers. We performed sensitivity analysis, and looked for publication and other types of bias. Lung (RR = 8.96; 95\% CI: 6.73\textendash 12.11), laryngeal (RR = 6.98; 95\% CI: 3.14\textendash 15.52) and pharyngeal (RR = 6.76; 95\% CI: 2.86\textendash 15.98) cancers presented the highest relative risks (RRs) for current smokers, followed by upper digestive tract (RR = 3.57; 95\% CI: 2.63\textendash 4.84) and oral (RR = 3.43; 95\% CI: 2.37\textendash 4.94) cancers. As expected, pooled RRs for respiratory cancers were greater than the pooled estimates for other sites. The analysis of heterogeneity showed that study type, gender and adjustment for confounding factors significantly influence the RRs estimates and the reliability of the studies. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To address this question, we compared risks of lung cancer associated with smoking by sex. Altogether, 585,583 participants from 3 Norwegian cohorts (Norwegian Counties Study, 40 Years Study, and Cohort of Norway (CONOR) Study) were followed until December 31, 2013, through linkage of data to national registries. We used Cox proportional hazards models and 95\% confidence intervals to estimate risks. During nearly 12 million person-years of follow-up, 6,534 participants (43\% women) were diagnosed with lung cancer. More men than women were heavier smokers. Compared with never smokers, male and female current smokers with {$\geq$}16 pack-years of smoking had hazard ratios for lung cancer of 27.24 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 22.42, 33.09) and 23.90 (95\% CI: 20.57, 27.76), respectively (P for heterogeneity = 0.30). In contrast, for current smokers, in a model with pack-years measured continuously, men had a hazard ratio of 1.43 (95\% CI: 1.39, 1.48) and women a hazard ratio of 1.64 (95\% CI: 1.57, 1.71) for each 10\textendash pack-year increment of smoking (P for heterogeneity \&lt; 0.01). Our results suggest that women have an increased susceptibility to lung cancer compared with men, given the same lifetime smoking exposure.},

  abstract = {Background Prevalence of smoking is increasing in women in some populations and is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Whether smoking confers the same excess risk of coronary heart disease for women as it does for men is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the effect of smoking on coronary heart disease in women compared with men after accounting for sex differences in other major risk factors. Methods We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies published between Jan 1, 1966, and Dec 31, 2010, from four online databases. We selected cohort studies that were stratified by sex with measures of relative risk (RR), and associated variability, for coronary heart disease and current smoking compared with not smoking. We pooled data with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting, and estimated RR ratios (RRRs) between men and women. Findings We reviewed 8005 abstracts and included 26 articles with data for 3\hphantom{,}912\hphantom{,}809 individuals and 67\hphantom{,}075 coronary heart disease events from 86 prospective trials. In 75 cohorts (2{$\cdot$}4 million participants) that adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors other than coronary heart disease, the pooled adjusted female-to-male RRR of smoking compared with not smoking for coronary heart disease was 1{$\cdot$}25 (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}12\textendash 1{$\cdot$}39, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). This outcome was unchanged after adjustment for potential publication bias and there was no evidence of important between-study heterogeneity (p=0{$\cdot$}21). The RRR increased by 2\% for every additional year of study follow-up (p=0{$\cdot$}03). In pooled data from 53 studies, there was no evidence of a sex difference in the RR between participants who had previously smoked compared with those who never had (RRR 0{$\cdot$}96, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}86\textendash 1{$\cdot$}08, p=0{$\cdot$}53). Interpretation Whether mechanisms underlying the sex difference in risk of coronary heart disease are biological or related to differences in smoking behaviour between men and women is unclear. Tobacco-control programmes should consider women, particularly in those countries where smoking among young women is increasing in prevalence. Funding None.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have reported converging lung cancer rates between sexes. We examine lung cancer incidence rates in young women vs. young men in 40 countries across five continents. Lung and bronchial cancer cases by 5-year age group (ages 30\textendash 64) and 5-year calendar period (1993\textendash 2012) were extracted from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Female-to-male incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CIs) were calculated by age group and birth cohort. Among men, age-specific lung cancer incidence rates generally decreased in all countries, while in women the rates varied across countries with the trends in most countries stable or declining, albeit at a slower pace compared to those in men. As a result, the female-to-male IRRs increased among recent birth cohorts, with IRRs significantly greater than unity in Canada, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United States. For example, the IRRs in ages 45\textendash 49 year in the Netherlands increased from 0.7 (95\% CI: 0.6\textendash 0.8) to 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.4\textendash 1.7) in those born circa 1948 and 1963, respectively. Similar patterns, though nonsignificant, were found in 23 additional countries. These crossovers were largely driven by increasing adenocarcinoma incidence rates in women. For those countries with historical smoking data, smoking prevalence in women approached, but rarely exceeded, those of men. In conclusion, the emerging higher lung cancer incidence rates in young women compared to young men is widespread and not fully explained by sex differences in smoking patterns. Future studies are needed to identify reasons for the elevated incidence of lung cancer among young women.},

This development together with additional options for record linkage and long-term follow-up will offer new opportunities for health services and outcome research.

  abstract = {PurposeAn examination of multiple primary cancers can provide insight into the etiologic role of genes, the environment, and prior cancer treatment on a cancer patient's risk of developing a subsequent cancer. Different rules for registering multiple primary cancers (MP) are used by cancer registries throughout the world making data comparisons difficult.MethodsWe evaluated the effect of SEER and IARC/IACR rules on cancer incidence rates and trends using data from the SEER Program. We estimated age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and trends (1975\textendash 2011) for the top 26 cancer categories using joinpoint regression analysis.ResultsASIRs were higher using SEER compared to IARC/IACR rules for all cancers combined (3 \%) and, in rank order, melanoma (9 \%), female breast (7 \%), urinary bladder (6 \%), colon (4 \%), kidney and renal pelvis (4 \%), oral cavity and pharynx (3 \%), lung and bronchus (2 \%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2 \%). ASIR differences were largest for patients aged 65+ years. Trends were similar using both MP rules with the exception of cancers of the urinary bladder, and kidney and renal pelvis.ConclusionsThe choice of multiple primary coding rules effects incidence rates and trends. Compared to SEER MP coding rules, IARC/IACR rules are less complex, have not changed over time, and report fewer multiple primary cancers, particularly cancers that occur in paired organs, at the same anatomic site and with the same or related histologic type. Cancer registries collecting incidence data using SEER rules may want to consider including incidence rates and trends using IARC/IACR rules to facilitate international data comparisons.},
